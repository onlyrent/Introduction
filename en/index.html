      <div class="about-title en-font">Only Rent is more than an app. It's a mindset.<br>Here, your worth isn't assigned. It's self-defined.</div>
      <div class="about-desc en-font">Only Rent is a service platform from Singapore, built on a simple yet powerful belief: your value should be defined by you.
In today's world, people are often boxed in by job titles, resumes, and market expectations. But we believe everyone has something unique to offer — a skill, a passion, a way to connect. Only Rent exists to unlock that potential.<br><br>Here, individuals can list the services they're good at — from nail art, photography, and baking to home cleaning and private lessons. You decide your prices, schedule, and how you work. You're in control. At the same time, customers can post what they need, and you can actively respond. This creates a more open, direct, and human way to connect.<br><br>We're launching in Southeast Asia, starting with Taiwan — a place full of bold, creative, freedom-driven individuals. Our mission is to help shape a new kind of work culture — one where freelancing isn't just an option, but a real, sustainable lifestyle.</div>
